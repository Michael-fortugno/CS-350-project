# CS-350-project
This project was to build a simple thermostat that can monitior the temperature 
in increments of 1 degree and allows a set temperature
when temperature drops below set temperature the heater will turn on
and when tempereature reaches set temp the heater will turn off.
this project utiized state machines to constantly check the state 
of the system to ensure code is working properly
overall there were not too many issues with working with the 
microcontroller, there was some frustation while developing code 
and debugging the program to ensure code was working properly
sometimes the code would work and sometimes I would get an error and have
to reset microcontroller and it would work
The skills working with the embedded systems can translate well
to other areas in the future it gives me a more low level view of a system
and with practice can develop a better understanding and help me grow
my reading, writing, and understanding of code in general
to help support my network I will continue to look at this project
and maintain and as my skills develop implement better more effecient
code and work on some independent projects working with the microccontroller.
ensuring I have good comments on my code I can ensure the code remains readable and maintaiable in
the future.
